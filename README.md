# Assignment3
Checks if each opening delimiter matches each closing delimiter in a source code file written in any language. If a mistake is detected, the potential line numbers, along with the cause of the mistake, are printed out to the user, and the program exits for them to correct that error. Only 1 error is printed out to the user per run of this program.

For the idea on how to potentially use a stack to perform delimiter checking, I used pages 204-205 of Data Structures and Algorithms, second edition, by Michal T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and David Mount.
